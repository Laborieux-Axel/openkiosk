Hi there!   

OpenKiosk is an open source project aimed at solving a very specific issue. 
Veggie oder Fleisch? Or should I ask: Veal Pojarsky or Creole Jambalaya? 
Pork Knossos or Cevapcici? With our daily-updated database of kiosk dishes 
pictures, you can now quickly look up what is *actually* for lunch at the 
Rosental kiosk beyond any cryptic description. 

Happy kiosk lunch!   
The OpenKiosk team.
